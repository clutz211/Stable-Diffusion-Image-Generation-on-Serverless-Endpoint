# Stable Diffusion Image Generation on Serverless Endpoint 

# 1) Project Summary 

This project implements a serverless endpoint on a GPU platform that generates images from text prompts. The goal was to create a working API endpoint that could take text descriptions and return AI generated images. 

## 1.1 What Was Built 
- A Docker container configured to run a Stable Diffusion model
- A serverless endpoint deployed on GPU cloud infrastructure
- A working API that can be tested using Postman

## 1.2 Key Features 
- Text to image generation
- Simple API endpoint that accepts text prompts
- Returns generated images in base64 format

## 1.3 Technical Stack Used
- Docker for creating the container
- GPU cloud for processing
- Postman for testing the API
